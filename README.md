**About the program**
-  Microsoft AI Classroom series is an initiative by Microsoft in association with NASSCOM FutureSkills® and supported by GitHub to train 1M students over 12 months.
-  The AI Classroom series is divided into three (3) easy to consume modules of 2.5 hours each; and includes live demos, hands-on experiments, and post session assignments to enable students to check their knowledge.
-  Please attend all three (3) modules to complete your learning for the series.
-  Each module will be introduced by leading data scientists and AI influencers; followed by 2 hours of learning session and 30 minutes of live Q&A with subject matter experts.
-  Two weeks of online support at no cost. Post the workshop series, students have access to online experts to address queries and to prepare for industry recognized AI certifications.
-  This program is open to students enrolled in Indian universities and are residents of India
-  Limited seats. Attendance is on first come first basis. If you are unable to join a session it may have reached capacity.


**Assessment & Certification** | [link](https://thetechco.in/MicrosoftAIforStudents)
-  Post the workshop completion, each student will receive an assessment link for knowledge check and to collect the participation certificate.
-  The assessment is designed as multiple-choice questions. You have 20 minutes to answer 30 questions.
-  You will get 3 attempts to clear this assessment.
-  The assessment link will be live between `September 28 to October 10, 2020`.
-  You have to score 80% or more to pass and download your “Microsoft AI workshop | September 2020” participation certificate.
-  The certificate will be a joint certificate offered by Microsoft and NASSCOM FutureSkills

1. What is a Workspace?     
Top level resource of Azure Machine Learning Sevice, it serves as a hub for building and deploying models. It stores the experiment objects that are required for each model we create.     
2. What is a Datastore?     
It is an abstraction over an Azure Storage account. Each workspace has a registered default datastore, still we can register another Azure blob or File storage contianers as a datastore.      
3. What is a Pipeline?      
It is a tool to create and manage workflows during a datascience process (data manipulation, model trainig & testing, development). Each step of the process can run unattended in different compute targets, which makes it easier to allocate resources.

**FAQs** | [MOC and AZURE pass](http://aka.ms/AI4students)
1. What Azure pass?     
To access Azure platform and try out services, you need subscription. So Microsoft is giving 50$ as Azure pass. You can utilize these credits for creating azure resources.
2. Any Guides for MOC and Azure pass?
